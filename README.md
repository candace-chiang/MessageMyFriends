# MessageMyFriends
MDB project 5!

BFFL Finder is the new Facebook! It is an app that is designed as both a location system and messaging platform. Users are able to create an account and set up a profile. Logging in and signing up are both handled through a link sent to the user's email, allowing for a quicker, more streamlined user experience. The app itself allows users to add other users as their friends; and once added, they are able to message and track the location of their friends.
